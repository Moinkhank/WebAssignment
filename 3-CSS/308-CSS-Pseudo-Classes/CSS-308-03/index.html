           <h1>Nikhil Chinapa</h1>
           <p>
            To say that Nikhil Chinapa has donned many an avatar during his career, is like saying it snows in Alaska; a bit of an understatement. <br>
             He morphs from DJ to VJ to MC to Music Promoter to Festival Director —some of his best known avatars — with amazing fluidity.
           </p> 
           <p>
            He studied Architecture and graduated with a Thesis in Hospital Design. <br>
             A year later and for reasons that scientists are still trying to understand, Nikhil joined MTV. He said, “I think it’ll be fun.” For once, he was right.
           </p>
           <p>
            At MTV, Nikhil has hosted almost every show the channel has aired. From MTV Select – <br>
            MTV’s longest running show, (it aired continuously for 10 years) to being the host of Splitsvilla, a judge on Roadies as well as Rock On and now host of MTV Mashups.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a popular VJ, Nikhil got to spend a lot of time around his first love, music. <br>
            In 2001, a conversation between friends resulted in the launch of Submerge — India’s first, and now largest Indian Electronic Dance Music (EDM) company in India.
           </p>
           <p>
            By now, Nikhil had begun to DJ professionally and plays, well… whatever he feels like. <br>
            His sets are moody, varied, often erratic but usually fun. <br>
            Most of his sets feature frantic foot-stomping and the random flailing of arms – sometimes by him. They also feature music – the kind that has a repetitive monotonous beat and is best enjoyed at dangerous decibel levels.
